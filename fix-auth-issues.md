# ðŸ”§ Authentication Issues Fixed

## Issues Identified and Fixed:

### 1. âœ… Cookie Domain Configuration Issue
**Problem**: Cookie domain was set to `localhost` in development, causing cross-subdomain issues on VPS where frontend (`app.dev.naramakna.id`) and backend (`dev.naramakna.id`) are on different subdomains.

**Solution**: Updated cookie configuration in `authController.js` to:
- Use `.naramakna.id` domain for VPS environments (allows all subdomains)
- Keep `undefined` domain for local development
- Auto-detect environment based on request host

### 2. âœ… Token Storage in Frontend
**Problem**: Frontend login form received token but didn't store it in localStorage for subsequent API calls.

**Solution**: Updated `AuthContext.tsx` to:
- Save token to localStorage when login is called
- Clear token from localStorage on logout

### 3. âœ… Logout Cookie Clearing
**Problem**: Logout wasn't clearing cookies with correct domain.

**Solution**: Updated logout to clear cookies with same domain logic as login.

## Files Modified:
- `backend/src/controllers/authController.js` - Cookie domain configuration
- `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext/AuthContext.tsx` - Token storage

## Expected Results:
- âœ… Login should set cookies that work across `dev.naramakna.id` and `app.dev.naramakna.id`
- âœ… API calls to `/api/profile` should work with stored tokens
- âœ… Image upload endpoints should work with proper authentication
- âœ… CORS credentials should work properly

## Testing:
1. Test login on VPS
2. Check if token is saved to localStorage
3. Check if `/api/profile` call works
4. Test image upload functionality
5. Test logout and cookie clearing

## Next Steps:
1. Deploy these changes to VPS
2. Test authentication flow
3. Fix remaining 401 errors for upload endpoints
4. Fix database timeout issues if they persist
